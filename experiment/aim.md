# Aim of the experiment

The aim of this experiment is to introduce the idea of polynomial-encoding of Reed-Muller Codes. The purpose of Reed-Muller codes, in the context of this present virtual lab on Modern Coding Theory, is for forward error-correction in communication systems. We present the properties of the code such as the blocklength, dimension and rate of the code.

The goal of the experiment is to help the user understand how encoding of Reed-muller codes work in a simple way . The user is expected to know basic idea about modulo-2 operations which occur on the binary field $\mathbb{F}_2$, and the basic notions of linear algebra.

## How to use this experiment and this lab? 

The user is recommended to try answering the questions in the pre-test before studying the theory part of the present experiment. Later, once the theory part is studied, and the procedure and experiment is practised, then the user can try answering the questions in the post-test. This schema is to be followed for all experiments in this lab by the user who desires to gain a strong understanding of the topics discussed in this lab.
